### **Chicken Soup with Ginseng \(**~~**not sure if**~~** definitely ancient Chinese magic\)**

Based off traditional Chinese medicine, this rich soup is meant to have restorative effects on the body and mind. Whether you believe in this kind of stuff or not, all I can say is that this soup is flippin' delicious.

Prep time: 20 minutes

Cook time: 2+ hours \(as with many soups, the longer it cooks, the stronger/richer the taste. 2 hours is the bare minimum unless you like water with a hint of chicken and ginseng\)

Serves: 6 \(or two of me\)

**Ingredients:**

1 Whole Silkie Chicken. can sub with roughly 1.5kg of regular chicken breast/leg. It goes without saying, if you're using the whole chicken, make sure it's cleaned properly.

200g lean pork

20-40g dried American ginseng root. double the amount if using fresh ginseng \(Personally, I'd go with Plenty of ginseng, but I've stated the recommended amount since it's basically 1 of the 2 main ingredients\)

1 tablespoon wolfberry \(aka goji berry\)

Enough rice wine \(2-3 seconds pour\)

Enough ginger \(0-2 slices\)

Plenty chopped coriander \(handful\)

**Instructions:**

1. Blanch the meats for 5 minutes \(10 for the whole chicken\). Rinse in cold water afterwards.

2. Prepare a big pot \(~4L\), fill with water and bring to boil, leaving enough room for the ingredients. bonus points if you use a clay or ceramic pot.

3. Drop that chicken and pork in.

4. Bring to boil, then leave to simmer at medium heat. \(If you're using a gas burner, you're in luck. Higher heat means a cleaner soup.\)

5. The waiting part. Remember, the longer you cook the soup, the better it tastes. However, this also means the volume of soup will also decrease. Add water according to the amount of soup you want left.

6. In the last 30 minutes, add the wolfberries, rice wine, and ginger.

7. After you deem the soup ready, add salt to taste. Add water if too strong, continue simmering if too bland.

8. Serve preferably in small ceramic bowls with a pinch of fresh coriander on top. Provide ceramic Chinese soup spoons to complete the image. \(But do whatever you want, YOU'RE the cook. Serve it in a cup if that's what you want!\) 

_\*Typically, if you add salt when meat is still in the pot, the oils from the meat will start coming out and will float to the surface. Remove the meat if you're sure the soup is ready for salt. If you want to keep adjusting after salting, remember to remove the floating oil with a spoon. This soup is supposed to be clean and healthy and the layer of oil kind of ruins that image._
