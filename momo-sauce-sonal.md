# Momo Sauce

## Ingredients

* Plum (Roma) Tomatoes _(6-8)_
* Cilantro _(1/3 bunch)_
* Lime _(1)_
* Green chillies _(4-5) Depending on your spice level_
* Garlic cloves _(1-2)_
* Black Sichuan Peppercorns _(10-15 seeds)_

## Preparation

Rinse all your tomatoes, green chillies and cilantro.

Pick stems off the green chillies.

Cilantro chop most of the stem off, up till the point where the branches start.

If your blender isn't that high powered then grind the Sichuan peppercorns.

Cut Tomatoes into quarters.

Heat a non stick frying pan in medium heat and add olive oil. Place all the cut tomatoes into the pan and cover it.

Toss the tomatoes once, we are trying to draw most of the water out of the tomatoes so the sauce won't be runny.

Once the tomatoes start wrinkling, take cover off and continue to cook the tomatoes until it's reduced volume by 30%.

## Blending

Place all ingredients in blender except the lime obviously.

Add a dash of salt.

Squeeze the juice of the whole lime.

And blend until everything is finely blended and there are no visible big chunks of anything.

Taste for salt and adjust accordingly and blend again to mix it thoroughly.

Pour out the sauce and let it cool before serving.

## Version with Sesame Seeds

You can also add Sesame seeds if you'd like, if you are going for a savoury sauce vs heat.

Lightly toast sesame seeds on a non stick pan, until light brown. Very light toast, and just add into the blender with the other ingredients.
