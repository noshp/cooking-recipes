* Olive Oil

## Preparation

I usually debone the whole chicken and cut up into small 1 inch cubes. You can follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfY0lrdXar8) on how to debone a whole chicken very easily. I usually freeze the carcass for making chicken stock later. If you like bones then you can just cut the chicken into your desired sizes.

Mince the garlic and ginger and set aside.

Slice the onions thinly.

Dice the tomatoes.

Pick the leaves off the Cilantro and chop.

Using a large stainless steel or non-stick saute pan, pour a generous amount of Olive oil enough to coat the enitre pan and bring the oil up to temperature in medium/high heat.

Add the cumin seeds to the pan and cook until the cumin seeds get darker in color.
Add the garlic, ginger, crushed red chilli peppers and the sichuan pepper, stir it for about 10-15 seconds.
Add the red onions and cook until they're semi translucent.

Add the chicken in and stir it to mix with all the oil and onions, add a generous coating of salt.
Thoroughly cook the chicken (about 10-15 mins of cooking), you can cover the pan to get the temperature up and then leave it open to let all the water from the chicken evaporate.

Once the chicken looks to be thoroughly cooked and most of the water is gone from the pan time to add the spices.
Add the tumeric and give it a nice stir to ensure the tumeric is evenly spread across all the chicken.
Add the Cumin powder and burbere and same as before give it nice stir to spread the spice.
Cook for another 4-5 mins, till you see some browning on the chicken/pan

Add the diced tomatoes, give it nice stir and cook until the tomatoes aren't visible chunky. You can add in a little bit of water to help cook the tomatoes and not let the chicken burn.

Add 1/2 cup of of water dependent on how water you want the curry to be, bring it to a simmer.

Cook until the desired consistent of the gravy you want, taste and add salt accordingly.
Once the consistency is achieved turn off the heat, add the cilantro and give it a final stir.

Serve with rice or any other medium you desire.
