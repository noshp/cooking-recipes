Instructions
---
- Heat up the oil up to 200 C, once 200C turn off heat and set aside to cool down to 130-135C, we don't want to burn the chillies and other spices if the heat is too high
- Lightly toast on pan corriander seeds, cardamom, pine nuts, sichuan peppercorn (can be toasted separately)
- Light toast the sesame until golden/light brown
- Pour red chillies in a heatproof bowl (can be a mixing bow), mix other smoky chillies as well by crushing them
- Add salt, as you see fit and a small spoon of sugar
- Once oil is at the desired temperature of 130-135C, start pouring it over with a ladle
- About half way down the oil, add in the toasted coriander, cardamom, star anise and mix
- Keep adding some oil and mix the chilli oil
- Add the toasted sesame seed, the dried shiitake mushrooms
- Add the rest of the oil, mix it all around
- Set aside and let it cooldown to room temperature
- Store in a glass container and put in fridge for 3-4 days
- Taste for seasoning, if it is weak, strain the oil from the chilli, heat it up to 130C-140C and add whatever is missing, mix it back up and bottle it up again
