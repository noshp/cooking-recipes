Original recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/peach-cheesecake-with-gingersnap-crust


Yield: 12 large servings; one 9" springform pan 

INGREDIENTS:

##Crust 
255g of CBL brand ginger biscuits from Sri Lanka *** MUST BE THIS BRAND SPECIFICALLY; EQUIVALENT TO 1.5 BOXES ** 
1/3 cup unsalted butter, melted 
Pinch of salt (exclude if using salted butter) 


##Peach "jam" 
6-8 peaches, pealed and roughly chopped 
2 tbsp white sugar 
1/2 tsp fresh lemon juice 

##Cream cheese filling 
4 8-ounce packages cream cheese, room temperature (approx. total 1kg of cream cheese since Canadian CC containers have measurements in grams) 
4 large eggs
3/4 cup white sugar (1/2 cup is good too if you want it less sweet) 
1/2 cup Greek yogurt (or regular yogurt/sour cream)
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract


STEPS:

For crust
Preheat oven to 350°F. Grind ginger biscuits in processor to coarse crumbs. Add butter and blend until evenly moistened. 
Press crumbs over bottom and 1 inch up sides of 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides. 
Bake crust until beginning to brown, about 8 minutes. Cool on rack. Reduce oven temperature to 325°F.

For peach jam:
Combine peaches, 2 tablespoons sugar and lemon juice in heavy large saucepan. 
Cover and cook over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves and peaches are juicy, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. 
Uncover and cook until peaches are tender and juices thicken, about 10-12 minutes. Peaches should be very tender and falling apart.
Cool compote.

For filling: 
Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese in large bowl until fluffy. Gradually add 3/4 cups sugar and beat until smooth. 
Beat in eggs 1 at a time. Mix in yogurt and vanilla. Spoon half of cheese mixture (about 3 cups) into crust. 
Spoon peach compote over by tablespoonfuls, spacing apart. Top with remaining cheese mixture.

Place large piece of foil on oven rack. Place pan with cheesecake on foil. Bake until puffed, set in center, and beginning to brown, about 1 hour. 
Place hot cheesecake on rack; cool 5 minutes. Run small sharp knife around pan sides to loosen. 
Place cheesecake, uncovered, on rack in refrigerator and chill overnight.

** IF YOU WANT AN EXTRA MOIST CAKE: put a pan/loaf pan with water in the oven with the cheesecake. This will create a water bath/moisture chamber.

DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover; keep chilled.
